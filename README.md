# MeshLine
Mesh replacement for ```THREE.Line```

Instead of using GL_LINE, it uses a strip of triangles billboarded. Some examples:

### How to use ####

* Include script
* Create an array of 3D coordinates
* Create a MeshLine and assign the points
* Create a MeshLineMaterial
* Use MeshLine and MeshLineMaterial to create a THREE.Mesh

#### Include the script ####

Include script after THREE is included
```js
<script src="THREE.MeshLine.js"></script>
```
or use npm to install it
```
npm i three.meshline
```
and include it in your code (don't forget to require three.js)
```js
const THREE = require('three');
const MeshLine = require('three.meshline').MeshLine;
const MeshLineMaterial = require('three.meshline').MeshLineMaterial;
const MeshLineRaycast = require('three.meshline').MeshLineRaycast;
```
or
```js
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { MeshLine, MeshLineMaterial, MeshLineRaycast } from 'three.meshline';
```

##### Create an array of 3D coordinates #####

First, create the list of numbers that will define the 3D points for the line.

```js
const points = [];
for (let j = 0; j < Math.PI; j += (2 * Math.PI) / 100) {
  points.push(Math.cos(j), Math.sin(j), 0);
}
```

```MeshLine``` also accepts a ```Geometry``` or ```BufferGeometry``` looking up the vertices in it.

```js
const geometry = new THREE.Geometry();
for (let j = 0; j < Math.PI; j += 2 * Math.PI / 100) {
	const v = new THREE.Vector3(Math.cos(j), Math.sin(j), 0);
	geometry.vertices.push(v);
}
```

##### Create a MeshLine and assign the points #####

Once you have that, you can create a new `MeshLine`, and call `.setPoints()` passing the list of points.

```js
const line = new MeshLine();
line.setPoints(points);
```

Note: `.setPoints` accepts a second parameter, which is a function to define the width in each point along the line. By default that value is 1, making the line width 1 \* lineWidth in the material.

```js
// p is a decimal percentage of the number of points
// ie. point 200 of 250 points, p = 0.8
line.setPoints(geometry, p => 2); // makes width 2 * lineWidth
line.setPoints(geometry, p => 1 - p); // makes width taper
line.setPoints(geometry, p => 2 + Math.sin(50 * p)); // makes width sinusoidal
```

##### Create a MeshLineMaterial #####

A ```MeshLine``` needs a ```MeshLineMaterial```:

```js
const material = new MeshLineMaterial(OPTIONS);
```

By default it's a white material of width 1 unit.

```MeshLineMaterial``` has several attributes to control the appereance of the ```MeshLine```:

* ```map``` - a ```THREE.Texture``` to paint along the line (requires ```useMap``` set to true)
* ```useMap``` - tells the material to use ```map``` (0 - solid color, 1 use texture)
* ```alphaMap``` - a ```THREE.Texture``` to use as alpha along the line (requires ```useAlphaMap``` set to true)
* ```useAlphaMap``` - tells the material to use ```alphaMap``` (0 - no alpha, 1 modulate alpha)
* ```repeat``` - THREE.Vector2 to define the texture tiling (applies to map and alphaMap - MIGHT CHANGE IN THE FUTURE)
* ```color``` - ```THREE.Color``` to paint the line width, or tint the texture with
* ```opacity``` - alpha value from 0 to 1 (requires ```transparent``` set to ```true```)
* ```alphaTest``` - cutoff value from 0 to 1
* ```dashArray``` - the length and space between dashes. (0 - no dash)
* ```dashOffset``` - defines the location where the dash will begin. Ideal to animate the line.
* ```dashRatio``` - defines the ratio between that is visible or not (0 - more visible, 1 - more invisible).
* ```resolution``` - ```THREE.Vector2``` specifying the canvas size (REQUIRED)
* ```sizeAttenuation``` - makes the line width constant regardless distance (1 unit is 1px on screen) (0 - attenuate, 1 - don't attenuate)
* ```lineWidth``` - float defining width (if ```sizeAttenuation``` is true, it's world units; else is screen pixels)

If you're rendering transparent lines or using a texture with alpha map, you should set ```depthTest``` to ```false```, ```transparent``` to ```true``` and ```blending``` to an appropriate blending mode, or use ```alphaTest```.

##### Use MeshLine and MeshLineMaterial to create a THREE.Mesh #####

Finally, we create a mesh and add it to the scene:

```js
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(line, material);
scene.add(mesh);
```

You can optionally add raycast support with the following.

```js
mesh.raycast = MeshLineRaycast;
```

### Declarative use ###

THREE.meshline can be used declaritively. This is how it would look like in [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). You can try it live [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-three-fiber-three.meshline-example-vl221).

</p>

```jsx
import { extend, Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { MeshLine, MeshLineMaterial, MeshLineRaycast } from 'three.meshline'

extend({ MeshLineGeometry: MeshLine, MeshLineMaterial })

function Line({ points, width, color }) {
  return (
    <mesh raycast={MeshLineRaycast}>
      <meshLineGeometry points={points} />
      <meshLineMaterial
        transparent
        depthTest={false}
        lineWidth={width}
        color={color}
        dashArray={0.05}
        dashRatio={0.95} />
    </mesh>
  )
}
```

Dynamic line widths can be set along each point using the `widthCallback` prop.
```jsx
<meshLineGeometry points={points} widthCallback={pointWidth => pointWidth * Math.random()} />
```

### TODO ###

* Better miters
* Proper sizes

### Support ###

Tested successfully on

* Chrome OSX, Windows, Android
* Firefox OSX, Windows, Anroid
* Safari OSX, iOS
* Internet Explorer 11 (SVG and Shape demo won't work because they use Promises)
* Opera OSX, Windows
